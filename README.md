## What does it do?
This plugin shows a nice `edit` button on the frontend when you are logged in and edit an blog article. When saving the article and clicking back to the article tab, it will automatically refresh.

When you click on another article, it will have the 'edit' button as well and by clicking it, it will open another tab where you can edit that article. And when clicking back to the article tab, it will automatically refresh.

## How to install
This plugin is not available in the marketplace of October CMS, so you have to install it manually.

Clone this repository to the `plugins\enovision` folder and name it `frontendeditbutton`.

```
git clone https://github.com/enovision/october-cms-frontendeditbutton frontendeditbutton
```
from within the plugins/enovision folder.

The `enovision` folder might not exist, so you have to create that first.

## Settings

You can modify the settings for this plugin when entering "Frontend" in the "Settings" of your October CMS installation. It will then show up under "Frontend Edit Button".
